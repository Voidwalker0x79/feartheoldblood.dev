I am a cloud security engineer based out of central Texas. I have a passion for creating hybrid cloud solutions leverging Infrastructure as Code and CICD pipelines as much as possible. For fun I can be found reading various forms of literature, practicing stocism (Aurelius, Seneca and Holiday), and playing video games. (It's obvious I am big fan of the From Software titles.)
